# Termgin - CPU-Only Game Engine

Termgin is a lightweight game engine designed to run exclusively on CPU, making
it a suitable choice for resource-constrained environments. Built with a focus
on simplicity and efficiency, Termgin utilizes the Entity-Component-System (ECS)
architecture and is entirely written in Rust.

## Features

### CPU-Only

Termgin operates without the need for dedicated GPU acceleration, making it
suitable for systems where GPU resources are limited or unavailable. This
characteristic makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of platforms.

### Entity-Component-System (ECS)

Termgin embraces the ECS paradigm, promoting a clean and modular code structure
for game development. This architecture enhances code organization, scalability,
and maintainability, allowing developers to efficiently manage entities and
their behaviors.

### Rust-Crafted

Termgin is implemented entirely in Rust, a modern and memory-safe programming
language. Rust's focus on performance and safety ensures that Termgin delivers
robust and efficient gameplay experiences while minimizing the risk of
memory-related bugs.

This text was written by ChatGPT. I was surprised that the writing turned out to
be more solid than I expected. However, I will rewrite it someday.
